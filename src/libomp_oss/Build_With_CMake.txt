               Building libiomp5 using CMake
               =============================

   ---- Version of CMake required: v2.8.0 or above ----

============================================
How to call cmake initially, then repeatedly
============================================
- When calling cmake for the first time, all needed compiler options
  must be specified on the command line.  After this initial call to
  cmake, the compiler definitions must not be included for further calls
  to cmake.  Other options can be specified on the command line multiple
  times including all definitions in the Build options section below.
- Example of configuring, building, reconfiguring, rebuilding:
  $ mkdir build
  $ cd build
  $ cmake -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=gcc -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=g++ -DLIBOMP_ARCH=32 ..  # Initial configuration
  $ make all common
  ...
  $ make clean
  $ cmake -DLIBOMP_ARCH=32e -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..                        # Second configuration
  $ make all common
  ...
  $ rm -rf *
  $ cmake -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=gcc -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=g++ -DLIBOMP_ARCH=32e .. # Third configuration
  $ make all common
- Notice in the example how the compiler definitions are only specified
  for an empty build directory, but other Build options are used at any time.
- The file CMakeCache.txt which is created after the first call to cmake
  is a configuration file which holds all the values for the Build options.
  These configuration values can be changed using a text editor to modify
  CMakeCache.txt as opposed to using definitions on the command line.
- To have cmake create a particular type of build generator file simply
  inlude the -G <Generator name> option:
  $ cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" ...
  You can see a list of generators cmake supports by executing cmake with
  no arguments and a list will be printed.

=====================
Instructions to Build
=====================
 $ cd libomp_top_level/ [ directory with src/ , exports/ , tools/ , etc. ]
 $ mkdir build
 $ cd build

 [ Linux* , Mac* Libraries ]
 $ cmake -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=<C Compiler> -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=<C++ Compiler> ..

 [ Intel(R) Many Integrated Core Library (Intel(R) MIC Library) ]
 $ cmake -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=<C Compiler> -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=<C++ Compiler> -DLIBOMP_ARCH=mic ..

 [ Windows Libraries ]
 $ cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=<C Compiler> -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=<C++ Compiler> -DCMAKE_ASM_MASM_COMPILER=[ml | ml64] -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..

 $ make all common

=================
Mac* Fat Libraries
=================
On OS X* machines, it is possible to build universal (or fat) libraries which
include both IA-32 architecture and Intel(R) 64 architecture objects in a
single archive; just build the 32 and 32e libraries separately:
 $ cmake -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++ -DLIBOMP_ARCH=32 ..
 $ make
 $ cmake -DLIBOMP_ARCH=32e ..
 $ make
then invoke make again with a special argument as follows:
 $ make fat
- The fat target is only available for the LIBOMP_ARCH=32e configuration.
- The fat libraries will be put in exports/mac_32e/lib while the "thin" libraries
  will be in exports/mac_32e/lib.thin and exports/mac_32/lib.thin

================
Compiler options
================
-DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=<C compiler name>
-DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=<C++ compiler name>

-DCMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER=<Fortran compiler name>
Unix* systems (Optional as compiler is default):
This option is only needed when -DLIBOMP_FORTRAN_MODULES is true

-DCMAKE_ASM_MASM_COMPILER=[ml | ml64 ]
This option is Windows* Only

=============
Build options
=============

==========================
==== Operating System ====
==========================
-DLIBOMP_OS=lin|mac|win
* Operating system can be lin (Linux*), mac (Mac*), or win (Windows*).
  If not specified, cmake will try to determine your current operating system.

======================
==== Architecture ====
======================
-DLIBOMP_ARCH=32|32e|arm|ppc64|ppc64le|aarch64|mic
* Architecture can be 32 (IA-32 architecture), 32e (Intel(R) 64 architecture),
  arm (ARM architecture), aarch64 (ARMv8 architecture), ppc64 (PPC64 architecture),
  or ppc64le (little endian PPC64 architecture).
* This option, by default is chosen based on the probing the compiler for
  architecture macros (e.g., is __x86_64__ predefined by compiler?).

---- First values listed are the default value ----
-DLIBOMP_LIB_TYPE=normal|profile|stubs
Library type can be normal, profile, or stubs.

-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release|Debug|RelWithDebInfo
Build type can be Release, Debug, or RelWithDebInfo.

-DLIBOMP_VERSION=5|4
libomp version can be 5 or 4.

-DLIBOMP_OMP_VERSION=40|30
OpenMP version can be either 40 or 30.

-DLIBOMP_MIC_ARCH=knc|knf
Intel(R) MIC Architecture, can be knf or knc.
This value is ignored if LIBOMP_ARCH != mic

-DLIBOMP_FORTRAN_MODULES=off|on
Should the Fortran modules be created (requires Fortran compiler)

-DLIBOMP_STATS=off|on
Should include stats-gathering code?

-DLIBOMP_OMPT_SUPPORT=off|on
Should OMPT support be turned on? (Not supported on Windows)
If LIBOMP_OMPT_SUPPORT is off, then both ompt_blame and ompt_trace are ignored.

-DLIBOMP_OMPT_BLAME=on|off
Should OMPT blame functionality be turned on?

-DLIBOMP_OMPT_TRACE=on|off
Should OMPT trace functionality be turned on?

=====================
==== Micro tests ====
=====================
After the library has been built, there are five optional microtests that
can be performed.  Some will be skipped based upon the platform.
These tests can be turned on (default) or off with the following options:
-DLIBOMP_TEST_TOUCH=on|off     -- Should the touch test be done?
-DLIBOMP_TEST_RELO=on|off      -- Should the position independent code test be done?
-DLIBOMP_TEST_EXECSTACK=on|off -- Should the stack be checked for executability?
-DLIBOMP_TEST_INSTR=on|off     -- Should the Intel(R) MIC Libraries be checked
                            for correct instruction set?
-DLIBOMP_TEST_DEPS=on|off      -- Should libomp's dependencies be checked?
-DLIBOMP_MICRO_TESTS=off|on          -- Should any of the above tests be done?
If -DLIBOMP_MICRO_TESTS=on is specified, the user can then call:
$ make libomp-micro-tests
which runs the tests.

============================================
==== How to append flags to compilation ====
============================================
- These flags are *appended*.  They do not
  overwrite any of the preset flags.
-DLIBOMP_CPPFLAGS=<space-separated flags>    -- Additional C Preprocessor flags
                                               (typically additional -Ddef=val flags)
-DLIBOMP_CFLAGS=<space-separated flags>      -- Additional C compiler flags
-DLIBOMP_CXXFLAGS=<space-separated flags>    -- Additional C++ compiler flags
-DLIBOMP_ASMFLAGS=<space-separated flags>    -- Additional assembly flags
-DLIBOMP_LDFLAGS=<space-separated flags>     -- Additional linker flags
-DLIBOMP_LIBFLAGS=<space-separated flags> -- Additional libraries to link
                                               to during link phase
-DLIBOMP_FFLAGS=<space-separated flags>  -- Additional Fortran compiler flags

===================================
==== Feature Based Compilation ====
===================================
-DLIBOMP_USE_BUILDPL_RULES=false|true
Should the build imitate build.pl's build process.
When this is true, the Unix* Release builds will build libomp
with -O2 and -g flags activated (same as RelWithDebInfo). Then,
the debug info is stripped out of the library and put into libomp.dbg
This is done for interaction with Intel(R) Parallel Amplifier.

-DLIBOMP_USE_ADAPTIVE_LOCKS=true|false
Should adaptive (TSX-based) locks be included?
These are x86 specific.  This feature is turned on by default
for IA-32 architecture and Intel(R) 64 architecture.
Otherwise, it is turned off.

-DLIBOMP_USE_INTERNODE_ALIGNMENT=false|true
Should 4096-byte alignment be used for certain data structures?
This option is useful on multinode systems where a small CACHE_LINE
setting leads to false sharing.  This option is off by default.

-DLIBOMP_USE_VERSION_SYMBOLS=true|false
Should versioned symbols be used for building the library?
This option only makes sense for ELF based libraries where version
symbols are supported (Linux, some BSD* variants).  It is off
by default for Windows and Mac, but on for other Unix based operating
systems.

-DLIBOMP_USE_PREDEFINED_LINKER_FLAGS=true|false
Should the predefined linker flags in CommonFlags.cmake be included
in the link command? This is true by default and should work for
Linux*, Mac*, and Windows*.  The --version-script flag on Unix* based
operating systems will be included regardless.

-DLIBOMP_USE_HWLOC=off|on
Should the Hwloc library be used for affinity?
This option is not supported on Windows.
http://www.open-mpi.org/projects/hwloc

-DLIBOMP_HWLOC_INSTALL_DIR=/path/to/hwloc/install/dir
Default: /usr/local
This option is only used if LIBOMP_USE_HWLOC is on.
Specifies install location of Hwloc. The configuration system will look for
hwloc.h in ${LIBOMP_HWLOC_INSTALL_DIR}/include and the library in 
${LIBOMP_HWLOC_INSTALL_DIR}/lib.
